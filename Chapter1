#Python Variable Name Rules
#    Must begin with a letter (a - z, A - B) or underscore (_)
#    Other characters can be letters, numbers or _
#    Case Sensitive.
#    Can be any (reasonable) length.
#    There are some reserved words which you cannot use as a variable name because Python uses them for other things.


#Operation 	What it returns
#x + y     	Sum of x and y
#x - y     	Difference of x and y
#-x        	Changed sign of x
#+x        	Identity of x
#x * y     	Product of x and y
#x / y     	Quotient of x and y
#x // y    	Quotient from floor division of x and y
#x % y     	Remainder of x / y
#x ** y    	x to the y power

#x += 1    # add then assign value
#x -= 1    # subtract then assign value
#x *= 2    # multiply then assign value
#x /= 3    # divide then assign value
#x // = 5  # floor divide then assign value
#x **= 2   # increase to the power of then assign value
#x %= 3    # return remainder then assign value

#>         	Greater that - True if left operand is greater than the right                          	x > y
#<         	Less that - True if left operand is less than the right                                	x < y
#==        	Equal to - True if both operands are equal                                             	x == y
#!=        	Not equal to - True if operands are not equal                                          	x != y
#>=        	Greater than or equal to - True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right  	x >= y
#<=        	Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right        	x <= y
